"Let's embark on a journey to create a full RPG with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this series, we're going to create a game similar to Pokemon Red/Blue or early Final Fantasy, but about pizza chefs.

There are tons of ways to approach a project like this... this is only one of them! Feel free to take the concepts covered 
in this series and build on top of them, change them, make them your own for your own game."
